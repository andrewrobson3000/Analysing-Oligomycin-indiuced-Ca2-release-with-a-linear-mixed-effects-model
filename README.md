## Introduction

This repository contains the code, data, and findings for our project on the effects of CALHM2 depletion on cellular lipidome, focusing on the reversal of oligomycin inhibition of mitochondrial ATPase between control and CALHM2 depleted cells. Our study aims to elucidate the role of CALHM2 in mitochondrial function and its impact on cellular energy metabolism.

## Project Overview

Mitochondrial ATP synthase plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism, and its inhibition by oligomycin can significantly affect cellular energy balance. This project investigates how CALHM2 depletion alters the response to oligomycin, with an emphasis on calcium release dynamics and mitochondrial ATPase activity.

# Fluorescent Intensity Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for the analysis of fluorescent intensity measurements comparing control and mutant groups over time. The project includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis using linear mixed-effects models, and visualization of the results.

## Features

- Data preparation and cleaning.
- Filtering data for specific time points.
- Calculation of mean and standard error for both control and mutant groups.
- Visualization of mean fluorescent intensity with standard error bars.
- Statistical analysis including linear mixed-effects models, ANOVA for interaction effects, and model comparison.
- Baseline correction for adjusted analysis.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you will need R installed on your computer along with the following R packages: `tidyverse`, `readxl`, `lme4`, `lmerTest`, `ggplot2`, and `car`.

Set the working directory to the location of your data file and adjust the script to match your dataset structure as needed.
